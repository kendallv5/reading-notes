I learned how to set up a web page by using Github. I learned how to use repositories which is the area in Git hub that allows you to create a webpage and input what you want on that web page.
I also learned the importance of paying attenetion to the small details when it comes to coding. It can completely stomp someone and leave them stuck. 
I learned about different editors and the importance of everyone using the same one. 

Line editor: In this, you can only edit one line at a time or an integral number of lines. You cannot have a free-flowing sequence of characters. It will take care of only one line. 

 
Stream editors: In this type of editors, the file is treated as continuous flow or sequence of characters instead of line numbers, which means here you can type paragraphs. 

Screen editors: In this type of editors, the user is able to see the cursor on the screen and can make a copy, cut, paste operation easily. It is very easy to use mouse pointer. 

Word Processor: Overcoming the limitations of screen editors, it allows one to use some format to insert images, files, videos, use font, size, style features. It majorly focuses on Natural language.
